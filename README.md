#Metric Calculator
A simple Java-based Metric Calculator designed for performing various metric unit conversions, area calculations, and volume computations. This beginner-friendly project is ideal for learning Java and understanding fundamental object-oriented programming concepts.

Features
✅ Metric Unit Conversion – Convert between different metric units (length, mass, volume, etc.).
✅ 2D Area Calculation – Compute the area of shapes like squares, rectangles, and circles.
✅ 3D Surface Area Calculation – Find the surface area of cubes, spheres, cylinders, and more.
✅ Volume Calculation – Determine the volume of various 3D objects.
✅ User-Friendly Console Interface – Simple text-based input/output for easy use.

#How It Works
The user selects a category (Metric Conversion, Area, Surface Area, or Volume).
Inputs the required values.
The program performs the calculations and displays the result.
Learning Opportunity
This project is great for beginners learning Java. It covers:

Basic Java syntax
Object-oriented programming (OOP)
Method organization and modularity
Handling user input and output in a console application
